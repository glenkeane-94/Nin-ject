Version 2.4.0.0
---------------
- Added: Support for default parameters. If not explicit binding exists for a dependency but there is default value defined it is uesd instead.
- Added: Support to define the constructor and constructor arguments using ToConstructor "to" overload
- Added: WhenInjectedExactlyInto When overload: Matches only if the target is exactly the specified type. This was the behavior of WhenInjectedInto in Ninject 2.2.
- Added: WhenAnyAnchestorNamed. Matches if any of the anchestor bindings is named with the specified name.
- Changed: WhenInjectedInto matches also if the target derives from the specified type.
- Changed: ToConstant bindings are in singleton scope by default
- Changed: Separate project for medium trust environments.
- Changed: Open generic bindings can be overwritten by closed generic bindings
- Removed: No web builds. All builds are have no reference to web anymore
- Added default binding for IResolutionRoot that returns the kernel.
- Bugfix, Breaking change: Get all will now return all bindings and not skip unconditional ones anymore in case there is a conditional one. This is the same behavior as the version 2.0.1 and bevore had. 
- Bugfix: Fixed that the CF and SL version of the activation cache did not properly remove the weak references
- Bugfix (for CF): The CF version threw an exception when a class had a generic method on a base class. This bugfix has the side effect that the Inject attribute cannot be defined on base methods anymore. It has to be defined on the overriden method! 

Version 2.2.1.0
---------------
- Bug Fix: For classes that have several virtual indexers and at least one of them overridden an ambiguous match exception was thrown when they were injected.
